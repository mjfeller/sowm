Dependencies
------------

- `xlib` (*usually `libX11`*).


Installation
------------

1) Copy `config.def.h` to `config.h` and modify it to suit your needs.
2) Run `make` to build `sowm`.
3) Copy it to your path or run `make install`.
    - `DESTDIR` and `PREFIX` are supported.
4) (Optional) Apply patch with `git apply patches/patch-name`
    - In case of applying multiple patches, it has to be done **manually**.

If you are using GDM, save the following to `/usr/share/xsessions/sowm.desktop`. It is still recommended to start `sowm` from `.xinitrc` or through your own xinit implementation
